# Data Science Student 

_I am Sudha Sahithi Murikipudi, a Data Science graduate student at Florida State University with a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. With hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling, I have worked on projects ranging from customer churn analysis to cell segmentation for medical applications. My time as a Data Analyst at Cognizant further honed my skills in data management, reporting, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to drive data-driven decision-making. I thrive in dynamic environments and am always eager to learn new tools and techniques to solve complex problems._

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, MATLAB, R, AWS
#### Analysis and modeling: Statistics, Machine learning, Data Manipulation, Data Analytics, Data Visualisation

## Education
- M.S., Interdisciplinary Data Science | Florida State University (_Aug 2023-May 2025_)

  _I opted for this course specifically because this program uses data science in not just one area but almost everything like Healthcare, Economics, Finance, Humanities, and many more. I improved my skills in Database management, Deep learning, Mathematics, and Statistics._


## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ Cognizant Technology Solutions(_Sep 2022-Jun2023_)**

_As part of a dynamic seven-person team, I played a crucial role in revolutionizing Union Bank's data management practices. This project encompassed the entire data lifecycle, from collection to analysis, and had a significant impact on the bank's operations._

- I engineered a robust data pipeline that streamlined the collection and cleansing of financial data. This system increased data accuracy by 30% and reduced processing time by 40%, enabling more timely decision-making.
- Leveraging my expertise in database management, I redesigned the bank's data storage architecture. This optimization improved query performance by 50% and reduced storage costs by 25%, enhancing overall system efficiency.
- I created a suite of interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau and Power BI, transforming raw data into visual insights. These dashboards became integral to monthly strategy meetings, facilitating data-driven discussions among senior leadership.
- Working closely with IT and compliance teams, I implemented automated data validation checks and reporting processes. This initiative not only saved 20 hours of manual work per week but also strengthened our regulatory compliance posture.
- I fostered strong relationships across departments, ensuring that our data solutions aligned with business needs. This collaborative approach resulted in a 40% increase in the adoption of data-driven tools across the organization.
  
_This project not only honed my technical skills in data analysis and database management but also developed my ability to translate complex data concepts into business value. It reinforced my passion for using data to drive organizational success in the financial sector._



## Projects
### Cell Segmentation of Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cells

I was part of a team that created an AI to find and identify multiple myeloma cells in medical images automatically. We combined some cutting-edge image labeling techniques with machine learning to make it happen. It was a mix of frustrating and fascinatingâ€”kind of like teaching a computer to see, but only for very specific things.

We pushed our model to 88.6% accuracy, which could speed up how researchers and doctors analyze cancer cells. It's exciting to think this might play a small part in improving cancer diagnosis and research.

### Estimation of maternal mortality rate using regression techniques

I worked on a project that used data science to tackle a really important issue: maternal mortality. We built a mathematical model to predict Maternal Mortality Rates based on various health and social factors.

The cool part was digging into the data and finding out which factors actually made a difference. Some were what you'd expect, but others were surprising. We used some pretty advanced stats to make sure our predictions were reliable.

In the end, we created a tool that could help predict where maternal mortality might be highest. The hope is that this kind of work could help healthcare planners and policymakers focus their efforts where they're needed most. It was a great example of how data science can be used to address real-world problems.

### Predictive Customer Churn Analysis

I led a project to build an AI model that could predict which telecom customers were likely to leave us. It was like teaching a computer to read minds but with data instead of crystal balls.

We dug through mountains of customer information, looking for patterns that might tell us who was thinking of switching providers. After a lot of tweaking and testing, we ended up with a model that was right 97.6% of the time - which felt pretty great!

The best part was seeing how our work helped the company keep more customers happy and stick around longer. It was a perfect example of how data science can solve real business problems and make a tangible impact.

This project taught me a ton about working with messy real-world data, the ins and outs of predictive modeling, and how to turn complex findings into actionable strategies. Plus, it was just plain fun to play detective with data!

### Credit Card Fraud detection system

I headed up a project to create a system that could spot fraudulent credit card transactions. It was a bit like training a very picky robot to play 'spot the difference' with financial data.

We dove into the world of machine learning, teaching our system to tell the difference between normal purchases and potential fraud. It was challenging - after all, we had to think like both the good guys and the bad guys to make it work.

This project was a great mix of technical challenges and real-world impact. Plus, it was pretty cool to feel like we were using math and computers to fight crime!
