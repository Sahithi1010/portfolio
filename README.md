## Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ Cognizant Technology Solutions(_Sep 2022-Jun2023_)**

_As part of a dynamic seven-person team, I played a crucial role in revolutionizing Union Bank's data management practices. This project encompassed the entire data lifecycle, from collection to analysis, and had a significant impact on the bank's operations._

- I engineered a robust data pipeline that streamlined the collection and cleansing of financial data. This system increased data accuracy by 30% and reduced processing time by 40%, enabling more timely decision-making.
- Leveraging my expertise in database management, I redesigned the bank's data storage architecture. This optimization improved query performance by 50% and reduced storage costs by 25%, enhancing overall system efficiency.
- I created a suite of interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau and Power BI, transforming raw data into visual insights. These dashboards became integral to monthly strategy meetings, facilitating data-driven discussions among senior leadership.
- Working closely with IT and compliance teams, I implemented automated data validation checks and reporting processes. This initiative not only saved 20 hours of manual work per week but also strengthened our regulatory compliance posture.
- I fostered strong relationships across departments, ensuring that our data solutions aligned with business needs. This collaborative approach resulted in a 40% increase in the adoption of data-driven tools across the organization.
  
_This project not only honed my technical skills in data analysis and database management but also developed my ability to translate complex data concepts into business value. It reinforced my passion for using data to drive organizational success in the financial sector._



## Projects
### Cell Segmentation of Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cells

I was part of a team that created an AI to automatically find and identify multiple myeloma cells in medical images. We combined some cutting-edge image labeling techniques with machine learning to make it happen. It was a mix of frustrating and fascinatingâ€”kind of like teaching a computer to see, but only for very specific things.

We pushed our model to 88.6% accuracy, which could speed up how researchers and doctors analyze cancer cells. It's exciting to think this might play a small part in improving cancer diagnosis and research.
